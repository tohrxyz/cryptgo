# cryptgo

I'm experimenting, trying to learn and having fun with ciphers, encryption and so on in Go. I'll see where will it go.

### Current usage:
```sh
go run main.go "$(cat testFile.txt)" <number to shift by>
```

You can use [some online tool](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher) to verify.
